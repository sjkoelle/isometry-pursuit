  abstract = "We present Low Distortion Local Eigenmaps (LDLE), a manifold
              learning technique which constructs a set of low distortion local
              views of a data set in lower dimension and registers them to
              obtain a global embedding. The local views are constructed using
              the global eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian and are registered
              using Procrustes analysis. The choice of these eigenvectors may
              vary across the regions. In contrast to existing techniques, LDLE
              can embed closed and non-orientable manifolds into their
              intrinsic dimension by tearing them apart. It also provides
              gluing instruction on the boundary of the torn embedding to help
              identify the topology of the original manifold. Our experimental
              results will show that LDLE largely preserved distances up to a
              constant scale while other techniques produced higher distortion.
              We also demonstrate that LDLE produces high quality embeddings
              even when the data is noisy or sparse.",

  abstract  = "In many dimensionality reduction tasks, we wish to identify the
               constituent components that explain our observations. For
               manifold learning, this can be formalized as factoring a
               Riemannian product manifold. Recovering this factorization,
               however, may suffer from certain difficulties in practice,
               especially when data is sparse or noisy, or when one factor is
               distorted by the other. To address these limitations, we propose
               identifying non-redundant coordinates on the product manifold
               before applying product manifold learning to identify which
               coordinates correspond to different factor manifolds. We
               demonstrate our approach on both synthetic and real-world data.",

               with d smooth functions from a scientist-provided dictionary of
               meaningful, domain-related functions. When such a
               parametrization exists, we provide an algorithm for finding it
               based on sparse regression in the manifold tangent bundle,
               bypassing more standard, agnostic manifold learning algorithms.
               We prove conditions for the existence of such parameterizations
               in function space and the first end to end recovery results from
               finite samples. The method is demonstrated on both synthetic
