\begin{frame}{What really is superposition?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Superposition is a phenomenon of latent spaces where the number of independent features that are encoded is greater than the dimension of the latent space.
    \item Noisy computation interpretation: intrinsic dimension of data manifold is higher than the dimension of the embedding space
    \item Sparsity interpretation: residual stream encodes tangent space of data fiber bundle.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Future directions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Investigate at what happens layer by layer.
    \item Investigate MLP and/or attention mechanism.
    \item Embed substrings (i.e. don't just score interpretability of entire input string)
    \item Tangent space lasso on most interpretable features
    \item Dimension estimation by stability analysis of $p$ \citep{Robert-AIZI-undated-qg}.
    \item Improved circuit discovery \citep{Bricken-undated-zm}.
\end{itemize}
