This extension is a local version of Tangent Space Lasso.
%The Hoeffding bound
%Dimension estimation, the failure of duality
%The presence of curvature

Tangent space basis pursuit satisfies a similar property \cite{Koelle2022-lp} but the normalization process differs.

It could be used in the stiching step of an algorithm like the kohli one
We leave aside the question of patch alignment \cite{https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11620.pdf, LDLE paper}.
The full gradient approach.
In this case normalization prior to projection is subsumbmed by the larger coefficients needed to get the tangent space.
Good news is tangent space estimation need not be performed.
Let's compare the coefficients involved in projecting versus not projecting.
We can perform regression in the high dimensional space instead of projecting on span of target variable.

With respect to pseudoinverse estimation, sparse methods have been applied in \cite{Sun2012-vp}

Even though by Lagrangian duality, the basis pursuit solution corresponds to $\lambda$ approaching $0$, the solution is sparse \cite{Tropp04-ju}.
about the lasso is that all coefficients enter the regularization path.
As we see by the correspondence between $\lambda$ approaching $0$ and the basis pursuit problem, some coefficients in fact do not go to $0$.
