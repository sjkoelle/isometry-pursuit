\section{Background}

\subsection{Problem}

Our goal is, given a matrix $\mathcal X \in \mathbb R^{D \times P}$, select a subset $\mathcal S \subset [P]$ with $|\mathcal S| = D$ such that $X_{. \mathcal S}$ is as unitary as possible in a computationally efficient way.
To that end, define a ground truth loss function that measures unitariness, and then introduce a surrogate loss function that convexifies the problem so that it may be efficiently solved.

\begin{definition}[Unitary]
A rank $D$ matrix $U \in \mathbb R^{D_\alpha \times D_\beta}$ is said to be \textbf{unitary} if $U^TU = I_D$.
\end{definition}

While this definition implies $D_\alpha, D_\beta \geq D$, this paper typically works with equality.
Even so, this paper uses the term singular values rather than eigenvalues, and Section \ref{sec:discussion} contains speculation that a similar set of techniques hold for rank-d unitary rectangular matrices.

The property of unitary matrices that motivates our ground truth loss function comes from spectral analysis.
\begin{proposition}[Singular values of a unitary matrix]
\label{prop:unitary_spectrum}
The singular values $\sigma_1 \dots \sigma_D$ are equal to $1$ if and only if $U \in \mathbb{R}^{D_\alpha \times D_\beta}$ is unitary.
\end{proposition}

As a ground truth loss function, we'd like the loss to be minimized uniquely by unitary matrices, invariant under rotation, and depend on all changes in the matrix.
The first desired property precludes, for example, the log determinant, while the last precludes the operator norm, also known as the deformation. %check
Finally, to simplify our overall exposition and exemplify the key features of the method, we'd like this ground truth loss to be as similar as possible to the convex loss we introduce.
In fact, these losses will behave equivalently over diagonalizable matrices.
That is, in a sense, the ground truth loss will be as convex as possible.
%Thus, in Section \ref{sec:ground_truth}, we introduce a new loss based on the LogSumExp function.

The equivalent property of unitary matrices that we use to define our alternative convex loss is slightly different from Proposition \ref{prop:unitary_spectrum}.

\begin{proposition}[Basis vectors of a unitary matrix]
\label{prop:unitary_basis}
The component vectors $u^1 \dots u^D \in \mathbb R^B$ form a unitary matrix if and only if, for all $d_1, d_2 \in [D], u_{d_1} u^{d_2} = \begin{cases}
1 \; d_1 = d_2\\ 
0 \; d_1 \neq d_2 
\end{cases}$.
\end{proposition}

We will show that the conditions of the antecedent of Proposition \ref{prop:unitary_basis} are satisfied by the solutions to the multitask basis pursuit problem applied to matrices consisting of suitably normalized vectors.
The vectors are in particular length normalized so that the post-normalization vectors with the longest length have length $1$.
As we show in Proposition , our main theoretical result,  the tendency of the multitask basis pursuit problem to select orthogonal features then ensures that a unitary matrix is deterministically selected, given that one is present.

\subsection{Isometries}

To avoid abstractness, we give the following definition in coordinates.

\begin{definition}{Isometric at a point}
A map $\phi$ between $D$ dimensional submanifolds with inherited Euclidean metric $\mathcal M \subseteq R^{B_\alpha}$ and $\mathcal N  \subseteq R^{B_\beta}$ is an \textbf{isometry at a point} $p \in \mathcal M$ if
\begin{align}
\| v^T D \phi (p) \| = \|v\| \forall v \in \mathbb R^D
\end{align}
$D \phi$ is the differential implicitly given by $D_{F}^E \phi = U D \phi V^T$ where $U$ and $V$ are bases for $(T_p \mathcal M)$ and $T_{\phi(p)} \mathcal N$, the tangent spaces of $\mathbb R$ and $\mathcal N$ at $p$ and $\phi(p)$, respectively.
% .  A Grassmannian.  (what is a Stiefel manifold?).
\end{definition}

Indeed, this is equivalent to the following property of unitary matrices

\begin{proposition}[Metric properties of a unitary matrix]
\label{prop:unitary_spectrum}
$U \in \mathbb{R}^{D_\alpha \times D_\beta}$ is unitary if and only if $\| v^T  U$ for all $v \in \mathbb R^{D_\beta}$.
% is this true for all matrices or just square ones.  All!  Cite dominique and marina.
\end{proposition}

Thus, in coordinates,$D \phi (p)$ is unitary.

In cite thesis, it is claimed that Theorem from tangent space lasso, the recovered explanation is a local isometry

%Note that in the case of tabular data, where $\mathcal M = \mathbb R^P$, and $\mathcal N = \mathbb R^D$, and $\phi \in \mathbb R^{D \times P}$ is a linear map, this is equivalent to saying that $\phi$ is unitary.
$X$ could be, for example, the Jacobian matrix $d g$ of a set of candidate coordinate functions $g = [g^1, \dotsc g^P]$.

% We assume that we are given a target dimension $T \leq D$ - do we?
% BIG QUESTION: RUN IN D = B?  What is rank of $X$?    It's D if not running D = B
