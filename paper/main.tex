\maketitle

\begin{abstract}

Isometry pursuit is an algorithm for identifying unitary column-submatrices of wide matrices in polynomial time. % find citation for convexity implying polynomial time.  Tropp?
It achieves sparsity via use of the group lasso norm, and therefore has constrained and penalized formulations.
Applied to tabular data, it selects a subset of columns that maximize diversity.
Applied to Jacobians of putative coordinate functions, it identifies isometric embeddings from within dictionaries.
It therefore has relevance to interpretability of learned representations.
